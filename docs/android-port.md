# Android port

This repository is being prepared for an Android 10+ APK with touch controls. The
Android target is deliberately configured in the project rather than through a
GitHub Actions workflow; CI workflow files are not part of this port.

## Current baseline

- Godot 4.7 .NET / C# project.
- Desktop renderer remains Compatibility for development.
- Android selects the Mobile renderer through `renderer/rendering_method.mobile`.
- Touchscreen input is enabled and mouse-to-touch emulation remains available for
  desktop testing.
- Existing keyboard and gamepad actions are unchanged.

## Export settings

A ready-to-copy preset template is available at `docs/android/export_presets.cfg.example`.
Copy it to the ignored path `Project/export_presets.cfg`, or create the same
preset in the Godot editor. The preset should use:

- Export path: `build/android/ProjectReignition.apk`
- Package / unique name: `com.projectreignition.game`
- Minimum SDK: Android 10 / API 29
- Architectures: arm64-v8a
- Orientation: landscape
- Renderer: Mobile
- Export mode: Release for a release APK, Debug for device diagnostics

`export_presets.cfg` is ignored by this repository on purpose. Do not add it to a
commit unless the project maintainers decide that editor export settings should be
versioned.

## Known blockers before a release build

1. `addons/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.gdextension` declares Android ARM64 libraries. They
   are not part of the upstream releases; the "Android APK" workflow builds
   them itself (`build-ffmpeg` job), for local exports use
   `misc/build-ffmpeg-android.sh` — see `docs/android-ffmpeg.md`. If the extension is not
   loaded at runtime, video playback is hidden while its surrounding audio and
   animation timeline continues.
2. A first-pass touch HUD is now connected as an autoload. It feeds the existing
   actions (`move_*`, `ui_*`, `button_jump`, `button_action`, `button_attack`,
   `button_brake`, `button_speedbreak`, `button_timebreak`, and `sys_pause`).
   It is visible on Android and can be previewed in the editor by setting
   `mobile/touch_controls_preview` to `true`.
3. The Mobile renderer needs a device pass for post-processing, reflections,
   particles, and texture memory. The project is large enough that loading and
   memory testing must happen on a real device.
4. The release build must be tested with saves, localization, level streaming,
   and the party/network features disabled or enabled deliberately.

## Local validation

The first validation should be done with the Godot editor's Android export and a
physical arm64 device. The repository currently does not assume that the Android
SDK, .NET SDK, Godot executable, or export templates are installed in the build
sandbox.
